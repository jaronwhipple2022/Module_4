# Overview

My app, "Wandering Bear" is a mock of the well known game, Flappy Bird. I have never written an Android app before, nor do I have experience with Java. I decided that developing an app would be an excellent learning opportunity and a way to introduce me to Java. I did not want to write a basic and boring "hello world" app so I decided to take the route of following a step by step tutorial, but playing with the code to customize it and make it my own.

To run the app, open Android Studio and you can either use a virtual device, or your phone to run the app. To Use your phone you need to turn on USB debugging in Developer Options and connect to the USB port on your computer.

# Development Environment

To build this app I used Android Studio and wrote it in Java. I used many libraries, including Threading, Bitmap, view, content, graphics, and sys.

# Future Work

- The first thing I would like to do to improve this app is make it so it doesn't look like the walking bear isnt having a seizure. I would do this by using different resources to create a cleaner look as a bear walking.
- Another Improvement I would like to make is add sounds. This would make it a more interesting app if there were sounds depending on how the figures interact with each other.
- In the future I think it would be fun to upload my app to the app store. I am not sure how copywrite would work where it is very similar to FlappyBird and i followed a lot of code from a tutorial.
